IOError
IndexError

Error handling, huh, yeah, what is it good for?
What is the purpose of 'try\except' in error handling?
It allows you to try a piece of code and handle any problems that arise
It allows you to have two different menu options
It's just for formatting, it serves no purpose
It stops bananas from getting into the system

Using a try statement separates off a piece of code that may cause /a problem when executed and the except statement will handle that problem
Wait, what was that?
Something happened, not sure what, but something definitely went wrong...
ZeroDivisionError
SyntaxError
RuntimeError
ValueError

A RuntimeError is raised when a generated error does not fall into any category

ZeroDivisionError

A zero division error is raised when the second argument of a /division or modulo  operation is zero.. like no cookies or friends
